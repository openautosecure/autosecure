    **FAQ**

    Q: Why do I need to verify?
    A: Verification helps us assign you your role. It also protects the server from intruders and sabotage attempts (a.k.a. raids).

    Q: How long does it take to get verified?
    A: The verification process doesn't take too long! You’ll usually get your roles within 30–50 seconds, depending on traffic.

    Q: Why do you need to collect a code?
    A: The code confirms with the Minecraft API that you truly own the account you’re verifying, it is required to verify because we are dealing with bots daily.
